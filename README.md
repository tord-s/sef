Group project

## Virtual environment 

You need a virtual environment with the packages in requirements.txt to run the program. You can use the global virtual environment or create a new one with the command ([docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)):

```bash
pip -m venv my_environment_name
```

## Installation of requirements

Use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the packages in requirements.txt. This can be done with the commands:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Tips

Use this command to see the packages available in your current virtual environment:
```bash
pip freeze
```

Run the program:
```bash
python main.py
```

Stop the program:
```bash
ctrl + c
```
